ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME 

This app is a user vs computer type of rock paper scissors game (from what I experienced online, this appears to be at top of the difficulty scale - with regards to these types of app's) created from scratch using React for the internals and CSS and tachyons for styling.

The most important part of the app (the logic behind the app's choices) has been designed in order to take advantage of user trends as well as reacts fast to ending streaks. As with everything, the app can be further improved and the logic can be refined further.

Try the app and let me know what you think. Any positive contributions are welcome.

Have fun !
